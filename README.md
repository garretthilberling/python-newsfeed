## Description
Python Newsfeed is a social media application built as an implementation of a Python API. Users can create an account or login, create/edit/delete a post, and comment on/like the posts of other users. The API was built using Python, MySQL, PyMySQL, SQLAlchemy (ORM), bcrypt (password hashing), Flask, and gunicorn. It was implemented into the frontend using Jinja for templating.
